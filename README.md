# mlm-app: Ultra-Detailed Codebase Documentation

---

## Overview

**mlm-app** is a modern, React-based web application scaffolded and managed via the [Lovable Platform](https://lovable.dev/). It is designed for interactive business management with a focus on user experience, modular UI, and rapid customization. The application is built using Vite for tooling, TypeScript for type safety, shadcn-ui for UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS for styling. This documentation provides a deep dive into every core part of the codebase, including project structure, file functionality, and technology usage.
